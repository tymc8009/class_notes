- classifier = will label something automatically

The Learning Problem
    - image size 28 x 28 = 784 pixels, each pixel is in gray scale
    - unfold each image into a vector of length 784
    - now we have vectors in 784-euclidan space:

        data space X = {0,1,...,255}

    - each image comes with a label, which is a digit that matches the number written down

    - input space X = {1,2,...,255}^784
    - output space Y = {1,2,...,9}

    training set --> learning algorithm --> classifier      
     (x,y),...(x,y)
        n = 20000                                        f:X->Y

    - How we measure if is is good: use a test set
        - in this example there is a test set with 100 instances of eachh digit
